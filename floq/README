"floq" stands for "Flow Oriented Query".  The program "floq" executes
queries qualfied on patterns in streams of records from many inputs.
In some ways, "floq" is like kafka2 with SQL-like qualification on queues.

The history of floq starts with the blobio repo at

	https://github.com/jmscott/blobio

and, in particular, the subdir blobio/flowd, many years ago.
