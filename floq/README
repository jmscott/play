"floq" stands for "Flow Query".

The program "floq" executes queries written in a pidgin query language, inspired
by QUEL//SQL.  The "database" is transient in RAM, being built from records seen
on various sources, such as processes (pipe), files (tail -f) and network
(udp packets, tcp[46] streams).  Comparisons to kafka2 are reasonable.

The history of floq started with a program named "flowd", many years ago,
as part of the github.com repo

"flowd" efficently coordinated process/pgqueries in order to populate a
PostgreSQL database.
