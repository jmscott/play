The talk will discuss a golang program named "hoq".

The "hoq" software is a vehicle for (hopefully) manifesting the abstract
concepts of "Communicating Sequential Processes" by Tony Hoare
(a godfather of golang) into concrete code.

The name "hoq" is a nod to a similiar program named "hoc",
described in the well known book titled "The Unix Programming Environment"
by Rob Pike and Brian Kernighan.  The code of "hoq" diverges from "hoc",
which is a traditional stack machine, because data is "flown" to the operands
of "hoq" via channels instead of being pushed and popped to a traditional
stack.  Experienced coders ought to be amused.
