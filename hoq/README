Our talk discusses a golang program named "hoq", which means 
higher order query.

The "hoq" program is a nascent vehicle for manifesting the abstract
concepts of "Communicating Sequential Processes" by Tony Hoare
(a godfather of golang) into code.

The name "hoq" is a nod to a similiar program named "hoc", richly 
described in the well known book titled "The Unix Programming Environment"
by Rob Pike and Brian Kernighan.

However, the code of "hoq" diverges from Pike's "hoc", which is a traditional 
stack machine, by flowing data bottom up to the operands of the hoq "machine" 
via channels instead of sequentially pushing and popping. The "hoq" model allows 
easy concurrency of composed operands.
